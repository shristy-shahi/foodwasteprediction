🍽️ Food Waste Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting food waste in retail stores using machine learning models. By analyzing past data, we aim to minimize waste and optimize inventory management. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model training to build an effective prediction system.

✨ Features
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 🛠️: Cleans and prepares raw data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊: Uses visualizations like heatmaps and scatter plots to uncover data patterns and relationships.

Machine Learning Modeling 🤖: Trains and tests various machine learning algorithms to find the best predictive model.

Dimensionality Reduction 🔻: Applies techniques like PCA to reduce the number of features while retaining important information.

Regularization & Optimization ⚡: Implements methods to prevent overfitting and fine-tune model performance.

Cross-Validation & Performance Metrics 📉: Evaluates model effectiveness using metrics such as RMSE, R², and the confusion matrix.

📂 Dataset
The project utilizes data from retail stores. The key datasets are:

foodwastedata.csv: The raw, unprocessed data.

final_food_waste_data.csv: The processed and cleaned dataset.

2021_population.csv: Additional reference data used for enrichment (if applicable).
